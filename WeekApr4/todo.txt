10,000 data points: First task: obtain uscities.csv file and generate two datasets:
dataset 1: just 10,000 datapoints sorted most population to least population
dataset 2: 10,000 triplets with c1 to c2 and c2 to c3 > 200km

Task1: Predict latitude (lasso, ridge, nn)
Task2: Predict longitude (lasso, ridge, nn)
Task3: predict population (lasso, ridge, nn)
Task4: predict distance from New York (lasso, ridge, nn)
Task5: utilize dataset2: closest city task (What we did this week)
